# TODO

# this should show the setup for a graduation-only standalone module.
# here there are two families, depending on whether we are graduating
# time or graduating age. They should be in the same module, but which 
# backend funcition is called should depend on whether the user has given
# time as the abscissa or age. The main reason why we have two functions 
# rather than a single wrapper is that the methods lists are different 
# for age and time.

# see graduate_time()
